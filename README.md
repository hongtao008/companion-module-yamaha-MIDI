## Yamaha Sysex MIDI

**Available for the following Yamaha Pro Audio Devices**

* CL1/3/5
* QL1/5

**Available commands**

* Selected commands
* Recall/Store Scenes & Libraries

This Module allows control of almost every parameter on the console. However, LOTs of commands are
undocumented, so this module is most suited to recording macros. 
If you find a common command that you want to add to the main file so it's easier to identify, 
please contact me.

Please visit http://www.checkcheckonetwo.com for help, discussions, suggestions, etc.
